# Privacy policy

## Data collection
RideTime collects as little information as possible. An e-mail is required for signup, your name should be recognizable by your peers but we couldn't care less if you have something to hide and make it up.
No data is ever shared with a third party. 
The App's functionality relies on user location which isn't stored anywhere, but it is used to request data from a server, which may log requests for debugging purposes. Some requests are further sent to [Trailforks](https://trailforks.com) completely anonymous.
Live location tracking, if enabled, stores user's location on the server and is erased when tracking stops.

## Data protection
We do our best to protect your data. All communication between app and its server is encrypted, the database and server require a secure certificate to be accessed, and minimal data is stored about users. 
No matter what data protection, it is ultimately up to you, the user, what you share with the internet. When you comment on a private ride and someone changes it's setting to public, it's still you who posted whatever it is you care so much about. This app exists to get off social media and out on the trails, so worry less about the internet and go for a ride!
