## What's done:
### Friendships
- You can join using Google or Facebook (Pinkbike coming soon!)
- Find your friends, add them to friend list and invite for rides!

### Rides
- Create a ride in a location near you (or anywhere in the world!)
- **Invite** your friends
- Set privacy
  - whether anyone can join or you have to approve new members
- Set visibility
  - Whether anyone can see and search the ride, or the audience is limited
    - **Private**: Only users you invite can see
    - **Friends**: Only your friends can see
    - **Friends of members**: Friends of all members can see
- **Chat** with other members to plan the ride out!

### Notifications
- Notifications about invites, friendships and new messages

## ToDo:
### Live location tracking on ride
Ever wondered where the shuttle is, or if Joey cased that jump way back up the hill? Or have you maybe lost your group in an unknown location?
Invite your friends and use live tracking while out on the ride to keep track of where you are and where's everyone else.
You will also be able to enable live tracking shared with your friends anytime.

### Design
I'm no designer by any means but I know there's a long way to go before I make this whole thing pretty. However, the priority is now an app that works and for that I need your input!

### Make going for a ride a lot easier
The app assumes you always know where you would like to go riding but it's not always the case! I'm working on polishing the process and am looking for feedback on how do you plan your rides?

### Planning a route with trails map
We'll have to talk to Trailforks about that! But there are options..
